# 🛍️ E-Commerce Flask App – Setup & Usage Guide

Welcome to the **E-Commerce Flask App**! This guide will walk you through setting up the project, running it locally, and using both admin and user functionalities without conflicts.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable Script Permissions (Windows Only)

If you're on **Windows** and using **PowerShell**, run this command to allow virtual environment activation:

```bash
powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

Next, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

* **Windows**:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

* **Mac/Linux**:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Ensure you're in the project root directory, then run the following to install all required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

To start the Flask application locally, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## 👨‍💼 Admin Usage Flow

### 1. Access Admin Dashboard

Visit the **Admin Dashboard** by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:5000/dashboard
```

### 2. Log in with Admin Credentials

Log in with your admin credentials.

### 3. Add Products

Use the **Admin Dashboard** interface to add product details and upload images.

### 4. Logout Immediately After Admin Tasks

For security and to prevent session conflicts with user flows, **always log out** after performing admin tasks.

---

## 👤 User Usage Flow

### 1. Register a New User

Visit the registration page at:

```
/register
```

Fill in your **username**, **email**, and **password** to create an account.

### 2. Log In as a User

Visit the login page at:

```
/login
```

### 3. User Features

After logging in as a user, you can access features like:

* **View products**
* **Add items to cart**
* **Checkout**
* **Submit product reviews**
* **Check updated products** (Newly added products by admin will appear in the user interface)

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### 1. Admin and User Roles Must Remain Isolated

* Admin should always log out before switching to user mode.
* Avoid accessing user routes while logged in as admin to prevent session conflicts.

### 2. Session Conflicts

* If the admin accesses user routes without logging out, it may cause cart/order issues.

### 3. Role-Based Access

* Admins should only interact with `/dashboard` and related management routes.
* Users should only interact with routes like `/cart`, `/checkout`, `/orders`, etc.

* **Flask**: 3.0.0
* **Flask-Login**: 0.6.3

## 💡 Troubleshooting

* If you encounter any issues related to session conflicts, double-check that you’ve logged out from admin before accessing user routes.
* Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
